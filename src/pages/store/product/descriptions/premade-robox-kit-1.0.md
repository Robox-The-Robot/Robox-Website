# Robox 1.0 Robot Kit: The Perfect Starter for Young Engineers  
Introducing Robox, the affordable, beginner-friendly robot kit designed to make learning robotics fun and accessible for everyone! Whether you're a teacher, a parent, or a student, Robox provides everything you need to build, code, and run your very own robot.<br>
## This kit is a premade kit
This means that the kit comes built for you! Perfect for people who just want a working Robox straight out of the box. In order to ensure the Robox does not come apart during transport hot glue will be used. Furthermore the Robox will be fully tested before being shipped in order to ensure that all components are correctly wired and working.
## Whats Inside the Kit
- **Raspberry Pi Pico**: A powerful yet compact microcontroller that powers your robot's brain. With its simple interface, the Pico allows programming with both drag-and-drop software and python for the more confident engineers! 
- **Wooden Chassis**: A sturdy, eco-friendly plywood frame that forms the case of your robot. Itâ€™s pre-cut and ready to assemble with slot fitting and zip ties!
- **AA Battery Powered**: A safe, easy to use, and cheaper alternative to a lithium ion battery powered robots **This kit includes AA batteries**.
- **All Necessary Components**: The kit includes everything you need for assembly, including zip ties, wires, and screws. So you do not need to waste time finding, ordering and shipping components and can just jump into it! 
## Easy-to-Use Drag-and-Drop Software
Robox comes with an intuitive drag-and-drop programming platform that makes coding simple and engaging. This visual programming environment allows students to create programs by connecting blocks rather than typing out code. Ideal for beginners, but for our more intermediate users there is also a prepackaged python library that they can use if they want to jump into text based programming! 
## Cost Effective Parts 
The Robox kit was made with repairability in mind, all the parts that are used in this kit can be easily and cheaply replaced or upgraded! This means that if a colour sensor breaks you don't need to scour the internet for replacement parts (looking at you Lego Mindstorm). This allows for robotics to not just be a private school activity but one that everyone can enjoy!
