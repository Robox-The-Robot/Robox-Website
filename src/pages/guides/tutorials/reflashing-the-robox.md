# Reflashing your Robox
So somehow doing something the Robox is refusing to boot, or the website is absolutely refusing to communicate with the Robox, don’t worry we have all been there but worry not as there is an easy way to reset everything back to when you first got a Robox, reflashing.

Luckily reflashing the Pico is a much quicker process than it sounds but be warned, this will delete everything you have changed to the Robox, so make sure to have a backup of your custom code otherwise it’ll be gone as reflashing is essentially nuking the Pico then building it backup. 

First, you need to boot the Pico in BOOTSEL mode, again this sounds way more complicated than the process actually is, the entire process is holding the button on the Pico before plugging the micro USB cable. This makes the Pico act as a USB device and you should see the Pico as an external drive
